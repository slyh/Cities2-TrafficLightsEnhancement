## Traffic Lights Enhancement Alpha

* Set traffic lights to various predefined signal modes
* Guide available [here](https://github.com/slyh/Cities2-TrafficLightsEnhancement/tree/master/GUIDE.md)
* Compatible with version 1.2.5f1

This mod stores extra data in your saves to provide additional functionality. Once the mod is removed, traffic lights and junctions should revert to default settings when a road update is triggered, but this cannot be guaranteed.

You cannot downgrade this mod to an older version. Cities saved with the new version are not compatible with previous versions.

The full change log can be found on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/slyh/Cities2-TrafficLightsEnhancement/releases).

If you find any issues within the mod, please report them on [the issue tracker](https://github.com/slyh/Cities2-TrafficLightsEnhancement/issues).

**Warning: These modifications are highly experimental. Your game may crash more frequently, and your save files could be corrupted.**
